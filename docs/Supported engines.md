**Tested in:**
- Chrome 26+
- Firefox 4+
- Safari 5+
- Opera 12+
- Internet Explorer 8+ (sure, IE8 with ES3 limitations; IE7- also should work, but no longer tested)
- Edge
- Android Browser 2.3+
- iOS Safari 5.1+
- PhantomJS 1.9+
- NodeJS 0.8+
- Deno 1.0+

...and it doesn't mean `core-js` will not work in other engines, they just have not been tested.
