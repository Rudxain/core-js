`core-js` project provides (as [`core-js-compat`](/packages/core-js-compat) package) all required data about the necessity of `core-js` modules, entry points, and tools for work with it - it's useful for integration with tools like `babel` or `swc`.

The visualization of compatibility data and the browser tests runner is available [here](http://zloirock.github.io/core-js/compat/), the example:
